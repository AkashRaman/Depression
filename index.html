And the stresses of school, relationships, and unrealistic expectations seem to be magnified a million times. But these road bumps, stressors, and emotions come and go… and we move on with life.

            According to international statistics, depression is an epidemic, with teenagers and youths in their early twenties being especially vulnerable. Almost 8% of teenagers are affected by depression, with suicide being the second leading cause of death among adolescents worldwide. Research has also found that more than one third of young people who struggle with depression don’t seek help at all. 
            <br/><br/>
            Overall, one in seventeen people suffer from Major Depressive Disorder at some point in their lives - and there are 350 MILLION people diagnosed with depression right now. Making it the leading cause of disability in the world.

                A person is diagnosed with a major depression when he or she experiences at least five of the symptoms listed below for two consecutive weeks. At least one of the five symptoms must be either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. Symptoms include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day</li>
                    <li>Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities most of the day, nearly every day</li>
                    <li>Changes in appetite that result in weight losses or gains unrelated to dieting</li>
                    <li>Changes in sleeping patterns</li>
                    <li>Loss of energy or increased fatigue</li>
                    <li>Restlessness or irritability</li>
                    <li>Feelings of anxiety</li>
                    <li>Feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, or hopelessness</li>
                    <li>Inappropriate guilt</li>
                    <li>Difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions</li>

                Lots of things can increase the chance of depression, including the following:
                <ul class="section-cause-ul">
                    <li><h3>Abuse:-</h3> Physical, sexual, or emotional abuse can make more vulnerable to depression later in life.</li>
                    <li><h3>Age:-</h3> People who are elderly are at higher risk of depression. That can be made worse by other factors, such as living alone and having a lack of social solution.</li>
                    <li><h3>Certain medications:-</h3> Some drugs, such as isotretinoin (used to treat acne), the antiviral drug interferon-alpha, and corticosteroids, can increase the risk of depression.</li>
                    <li><h3>Conflict:-</h3> Depression in someone who has the biological vulnerability to it may result from personal conflicts or disputes with family members or friends.</li>
                    <li><h3>Death or loss:-</h3> Sadness or grief after the death or loss of a loved one, though natural, can increase the risk of depression.</li>
                    <li><h3>Gender:-</h3>  Women are about twice as likely as men to become depressed. No one's sure why. The hormonal changes that women go through at different times of their lives may play a role.</li>
                    <li><h3>Genes:-</h3> A family history of depression may increase the risk. It's thought that depression is a complex trait, meaning there are probably many different genes that each exert small effects, rather than a single gene that contributes to disease risk. The genetics of depression, like most psychiatric disorders, are not as simple or straightforward as in purely genetic diseases such as Huntington's chorea or cystic fibrosis.</li>
                    <li><h3>Major events:-</h3> Even good events such as starting a new job, graduating, or getting married can lead to depression. So can moving, losing a job or income, getting divorced, or retiring. However, the syndrome of clinical depression is never just a "normal" response to stressful life events.</li>
                    <li><h3>Other personal problems:-</h3> Problems such as social isolation due to other mental illnesses or being cast out of a family or social group can contribute to the risk of developing clinical depression.</li>
                    <li><h3>Serious illnesses:-</h3> Sometimes, depression happens along with a major illness or may be triggered by another medical condition.</li>
                    <li><h3>Substance misuse:-</h3> Nearly 30% of people with substance misuse problems also have major or clinical depression. Even if drugs or alcohol temporarily make the feel better, they ultimately will aggravate depression.</li>

                        <h2>Effect</h2>
                        Untreated depression increases the chance of risky behaviors such as drug or alcohol addiction. It also can ruin relationships, cause problems at work, and make it difficult to overcome serious illnesses.<br/><br/>
                        Depression can render people disabled in their work life, family life, and social life. Left untreated, clinical depression is as costly as heart disease or AIDS to the U.S. economy. Untreated depression is responsible for more than 200 million days lost from work each year. The annual cost of untreated depression is more than $43.7 billion in absenteeism from work, lost productivity, and direct treatment costs.            
                        <h3>Physical Health:-</h3>
                        The most recent studies exploring health and major depression have looked at patients with stroke or coronary artery disease. Results have shown that people with major depression who are recovering from strokes or heart attacks have a more difficult time making health care choices. They also find it more difficult to follow their doctor's instructions and to cope with the challenges their illness presents. Another study found that patients with major depression have a higher risk of death in the first few months after a heart attack.<br/><br/>

                        <h3>Depression in Men and Women:-</h3>
                        Men who have untreated clinical depression may exhibit more anger, frustration, and violent behavior than women. In addition, men with untreated depression may take dangerous risks such as reckless driving and having unsafe sex. Men are not aware that physical symptoms, such as headaches, digestive disorders and chronic pain, can be symptoms of depression.
                        <h3>suicide:-</h3>
                        Most people who suffer from clinical depression do not attempt suicide. But according to the National Institute of Mental Health, more than 90% of people who die from suicide have depression and other mental disorders, or a substance abuse disorder. Men commit almost 75% of suicides, even though twice as many women attempt it.<br/><br/>
                        The elderly experience more depression and suicide than you might think. Forty percent of all suicide victims are adults over the age of 60. Older adults suffer more frequently from depression because of the frequent loss of loved ones and friends as they age. They also experience more chronic illnesses, more major life changes like retirement, and the transition into assisted living or nursing care.

To someone with depression, these first steps can seem insurmountable.
